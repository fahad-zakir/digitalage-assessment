        <ul class="text-left list-disc ml-6 mb-8">
    Digitalage was founded in 2021 by tech entrepreneurs and social media pioneers dedicated to positively disrupting the
    status quo. They witnessed first-hand the ways existing social platforms exploit users and creators to drive engagement
    over wellbeing. Digitalage rises from those learnings - and functions on an ethical foundation of transparency, equity
    and trust.
